## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a weather application that will allow the user to check the 5 day forecast of any city in the US. The purpose of this application is to make sure our users stay informed on the weather of their area.

✋ [Deployed App] https://ahsan-zaidi.github.io/weather-dashboard/


## ✋User Story

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## ✋Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
